The Payment Requests extension can be enabled via the Rehive [dashboard](https://dashboard.rehive.com). You can access the list of Rehive extensions in the side bar. Simply activate the Payment Requests extension to add it to the platform.

Once activated it is important to review all currency pairs on the conversion extension and make sure all rate pairs you expect users to pay/recieve requests in have been setup.

	Once the extension is activated you can manage it via the dashboard or alternatively you can make use of the API directly. Do not activate the extension by calling the extension's activate endpoint directly.
