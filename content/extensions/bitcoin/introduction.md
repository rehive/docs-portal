The Bitcoin extension is used as an interface between the Bitcoin and Rehive ledgers. It provides an API for a company to create and manage a Bitcoin wallet. There is both a mainnet Bitcoin Service as well as a Bitcoin Testnet Service.

The extension allows you to:

1. Accept Bitcoin deposits from user
3. Allow users to transact directly on the Bitcoin blockchain
4. Manage and view user transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain
5. Manage operational accounts such as a hot wallet and warm storage
6. Setup HD deposit accounts to allow for a unique user address per deposit
