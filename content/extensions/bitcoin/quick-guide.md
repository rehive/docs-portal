The Bitcoin extension can be enabled via the Rehive [dashboard](https://dashboard.rehive.com). You can access the list of Rehive extensions in the side bar. It is recommended to start with the testnet service first. Simply activate the Bitcoin Testnet extension to add it to the platform and follow the setup wizard.

Once comfortable with the testnet service the mainnet service can be activated by contacting us.

	Once the extension is activated you can manage it via the dashboard or alternatively you can make use of the API directly. Do not activate the extension by calling the extension's activate endpoint directly.
