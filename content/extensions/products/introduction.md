The product extension is used to manage orders, products and payments. It allows companies to setup a simple multi currency ecommerce store that rides on the Rehive transaction ledger for payments.

The extension allows you to:

1. Create, retrieve and configure products (with extensive customization)
2. Create pending carts that can be converted to orders
3. Handle rehive payments and order placement.
