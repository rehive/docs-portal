Rehive has several resources and examples you can use when developing extensions.

Our **base extension framework** is publicly available here:

https://github.com/rehive/service-framework

We advise using this as a starting point if you are happy working with Python and Django. If you intend using another language or framework you can still use the above as "conceptual" guide. This example includes the minimum requirements to support a Rehive approved multi-company extension.

There is also a **simplified demo** written in Flask to show how webhooks can be used to power an extension:

https://github.com/rehive/python-service-demo/blob/master/app.py

Finally, our **python** and **javascript** SDKs can be used to make Rehive API usage simpler:
