Rehive has an extensive list of Python resources and examples.

Our **base extension framework** is publically available here:

https://github.com/rehive/service-framework

We advise using this as a starting point if you are happy working with Django. If you intend using another framework you can still use the above as "conceptual" guide. This example includes the minimum requirements to support a Rehive aproved multi-company extension.

There is also a **simplified demo** written in Flask to show how webhooks can be used to power an extension:

https://github.com/rehive/python-service-demo/blob/master/app.py

Finally, our **python SDK** can be used to make accessing the platform API less of a hassle:
