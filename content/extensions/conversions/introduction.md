The conversion extension is used to manage currency rates, quotes and conversion transactions. It allows for companies to access data regarding current rates (provided by a reliable 3rd party rates source) as well as set their own custom rates for specific currency pairs.

Currently the extension lets you:

1. Enable automated rates for specific currency pairs.
2. Enable fixed rates for specific currency pairs.
3. Expose these rates to end users.
