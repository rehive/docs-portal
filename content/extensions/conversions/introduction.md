The conversion extension is used to manage currency rates, quotes and conversion transactions. It allows for companies to access data regarding current rates (provided by a reliable 3rd party rates source) as well as set their own custom rates for specific currency pairs.

Currently the extension allows you to:

1. Retrieve rates for common global currency pairs.
2. Enable and retrieve rates for custom currency pairs.
3. Set rate paths for currency pairs.
4. Add custom currencies for rate pairs.
