The Stellar extension is used as an interface between the Stellar and Rehive ledgers. It provides an API for a company to create and manage a Stellar application. There is both a mainnet Stellar Service as well as a Stellar Testnet Service.

4. Manage and view user transactions on the Stellar ledger
5. Manage operational accounts such as a hot wallet and warm storage
6. Setup federation addresses
