The Stellar extension is used as an interface between the Stellar and Rehive ledgers. It provides an API for a company to create and manage a Stellar wallet. There is both a mainnet Stellar Service as well as a Stellar Testnet Service.

The extension allows you to:

1. Accept any Stellar asset as a deposit from users
2. Add any Stellar token
3. Allow users to transact directly on the Stellar ledger
4. Manage and view user transactions on the Stellar ledger
5. Manage operational accounts such as a hot wallet and warm storage
6. Setup federation addresses
