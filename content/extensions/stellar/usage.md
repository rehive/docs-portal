The Stellar extension API is organized around the same RESTful principles as the Rehive platform. Many of the rules found in the patform are applicable to the Stellar extension. This is  specifically true of authorization, errors, filters, and pagination.

Similar to the platform the Stellar extension is divided into two sections:

1. admin : admin endpoints are prefixed with `admin`
2. user : user endpoints are prefixed with `user`

### Admin

The admin section of the API provides an interface to adminsitrate (create, read, update and delete) the rates.

### User

The user section of the API provides an interface to view the rates.
