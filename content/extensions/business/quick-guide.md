The Business extension can be enabled via the Rehive [dashboard](https://dashboard.rehive.com). You can access the list of Rehive extensions in the side bar. Simply activate the Business extension to add it to the platform.

Once activated the business extension settings should be updated to have a list of manager groups that are allowed to create and manage businesses on their user accounts.

	Once the extension is activated you can manage it via the dashboard or alternatively you can make use of the API directly. Do not activate the extension by calling the extension's activate endpoint directly.
