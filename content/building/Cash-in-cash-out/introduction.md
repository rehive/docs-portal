Rehive consists of three parts: Platform, Extensions, and Applications. This overview assumes that you are familiar with these. 

We’ll look at the typical structure for integrating with a banking partner for deposits and withdrawals via bank transfer. For each flow, we will highlight which Rehive endpoints to use.

The first place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the [Get Started section](/building/get-started/introduction/). This gives a basic overview of how to start building an extension as well as the ground-level endpoints you’ll need to use. You should also familiarize yourself with [Rehive’s Standard Configurations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdWBY2Oim2EPWv2-ZNKIPXDbnULbSf-DiUfuCw7_zQg/edit#) to ensure that the correct subtypes are used for specific transactions.
