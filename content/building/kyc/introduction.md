This guide will describe the typical integration structure for a KYC partner. Two scenarios will be covered:

1. Recommended flow, where each requirement is verified separately by the third party and the verification status updated on  Rehive
2. A less common flow, where only one user verification status is returned by the third party and a user verification status is updated on Rehive

The guide will highlight which Rehive endpoints to use at each point in the process.

The first place to start is by familiarizing yourself with the [Get Started section](/building/get-started/introduction/). This gives a basic overview of how to start building an extension as well as the ground-level endpoints you’ll need to use. You should also familiarize yourself with [Rehive’s Standard Configurations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdWBY2Oim2EPWv2-ZNKIPXDbnULbSf-DiUfuCw7_zQg/edit#) to ensure that the correct subtypes are used for specific transactions.
