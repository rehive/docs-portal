### Deposit to a single company bank account

We now consider the use case that involves the users depositing funds to a single company bank account, with a unique  Account reference. Feel free to test this flow on your test project in the Rehive Wallets.

#### Requirements
* The details of the bank account you wish to receive deposit funds into must be added in the [Rehive Admin Dashboard>Settings>Bank accounts](https://dashboard.rehive.com/#/settings/bank-accounts). The currencies you list for each bank account will determine which bank account information is displayed when a user selected “Deposit” for each currency in the Wallet applications.
* Relevant monitoring of the bank account will need to be implemented per requirements from your banking partner. This can be in the form of polling done by your extension, or webhooks triggered by your banking partner. In this guide we assume that the banking partner notifies the extension of a new transaction.
* The user must be on a [Tier](https://rehive.intercom.help/en/collections/2574043-rehive-setup-and-standard-configurations#what-are-tiers-and-tier-requirements) which allows deposit transactions. Tiers are configured per [Group](https://rehive.intercom.help/en/articles/5904250-how-do-groups-work) using the [Rehive Admin Dashboard](https://dashboard.rehive.com/#/groups/overview).

When the user selects “Deposit” from either their web or mobile wallet, they will be shown the information for the bank account listed above as well as a reference which the user must include in the reference field of their bank transfer. This reference is unique to the user and indicates the account reference to which the funds should be credited in the Rehive system.

**Note: For the case where a unique deposit bank account will be generated by the payment processor for each user, the integration will be different, Rehive is considering adding support for this to our backlog.**


#### Steps:
1. The user selects “Deposit” and is shown details of the bank account you wish to receive deposit funds into and a unique reference.
2. The user makes a bank transfer to the company bank account provided and includes the unique reference in the reference field
3. Your custom extension polls the transaction history of the company bank account. 
4. When a new transaction is detected, your custom extension creates a credit transaction on the Rehive API endpoint <code> [admin/transactions/credit/](https://docs.platform.rehive.com/tag/Admin#operation/admin_transactions_credit_create)</code> with 
```json
{
    "status": "complete",
    "subtype": "deposit_bank",
    "account": "{unique_reference}"
}

```

#### Recommended additional configurations:

* Create and customize notifications using the [Notifications Extension](https://dashboard.rehive.com/#/extensions/notifications/list) to ping users when a new deposit transaction is created. This is included in the flow above as the final step.
