The Rehive platform provides a wide range of resources to make development of financial technology easier. A total of five core resources are pivotal to using the platform. These resources are:

1. Companies
2. Users
3. Assets
4. Accounts
5. Transactions

These five resources will be  addressed in detail within this documentation. However, if you are looking for an in-depth description of all the resources the platform offers then it is best to review the full API reference (TODO add link).
