Through the application of groups, Platform users can be categorized into roles and/or configurations that are applicable to them. In its simplest form, groups can be used to seperate one category of customers from another, while at its most complex groups cab be used to configure entirely different onboarding, KYC processes, and permissions to users that fall into entirely different business cases.

Each user in the Platform can be part of one group. When a user is assigned to a group, the following group related settings will apply:

- Group specific permissions
- Group specific transaction settings
	- Disallowed transaction types
	- Disallowed transaction subtypes
	- Transaction fees
- Group specific tiers (and their requirements)
- Group specific account definitions (the accounts that apply to users in the group).
- Group specific access rules
	- Access control rules.
	- Multi-factor authentication rules.
