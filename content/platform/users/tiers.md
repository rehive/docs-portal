Tiers are the primary tool available for configuring variations in available functionality (and the execution of that functionaly). These variations are the applied automatically based on a users group and they highest tier they fulfull the reuirements for.

For instance, a company could setup two tiers that limit the max amount a user can transfer based on what data the user has submitted. This could be as simple as setting a USD 0.00 limit if the user has not verified their email address and setting a USD 1000.00 limit if they have verified their email address. By default, companies are preloaded with sensible tiers and tier requirements but the Platform makes it easy to adjust or completely overhaul the tiers as needed to suit different business requirements.

### Requirement sets and items

In order to configure what users a tier applies to, the Platform supports a highly configurable system for rule customization. Custommization is done via "requirement sets" and "requirement items" that allow for highly adaptable hierarchy of conditions.

The best way to apply tier customizations is to access them in the dashboard, which includes a feature-rich interface for handling all possible condition sets and rules available in the Platform.
