Closed-loop payments involve the user paying directly from their wallet balance to your merchant account. There are a few options available to the ender user but each work in a very similar way. The options you should present to the user if they chose to pay with their wallet balance are as follows, any can be omitted depending on what you would like to support:

### Scan to Pay and Login to Pay
To be added.

### OTP payment

An OTP payment is one that is authorized by a single use OTP code that is sent to a user authorized mobile number.

The required information from the user is:
1. An email address
2. A mobile number that validated on their wallet

Once the user has provided this information you will need to PATCH the Invoice as follows:
```
curl -X PATCH "/requests/<invoice-id>/" -H "accept: application/json" 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d "{ \"payer_email\": \"user@example.com\", \"payer_mobile_number\": \"+27777777777\"}"
```

If successful the user will receive an SMS with the OTP code. You will need to provide a way for the user to enter this code so you can make a POST request to: `/manager/businesses/<business_id>/invoice/<invoice-id>/otp-challenge` as follows:
```
curl -X POST "/requests/<invoice-id>/otp_challenge/" 
-H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"otp": "401703"}'
```

This is a simple Success/Response endpoint. On a successful 201 response a transfer will be created automatically between you and the user. Any errors will need to be forwarded to the end user.
