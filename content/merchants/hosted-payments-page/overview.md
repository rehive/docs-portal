The hosted option allows for minimal integration to get started with receiving payments from customers. All user interaction for selecting and viewing invoice information will be handled on the hosted invoice page.

### The basic flow

1. A customer will select Rehive as the payment option
2. An invoice is generated with a link to redirect the user to the hosted payments page
3. The customer is redirected to the hosted page which handles the selection and display of payment options
4. Once the payment has been processed the hosted payments page will redirect the user back if specified
5. A webhook is sent to any relevant services when the Invoice has been completed.
